      <h3 class="section__spareparts">Structural Components:</h3>
      <p class="section__subheader">
      Structural components refer to the fixed, building-integrated parts that form the physical framework for the elevator system. These are not typically replaced during standard maintenance or considered "spare parts" because they are not designed to wear out in normal operation.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section__spareparts">Mechanical Components:</h3>
      <ul class="section__subheader">
        <li>Guide Shoes / Rollers – Guide the car along rails</li>
        <li>Elevator Ropes / Belts – Support and move the elevator (traction type)</li>
        <li>Overspeed Governor – Stops the elevator if it moves too fast</li>
        <li>Safety Gear – Engages the rail if there's an emergency stop</li>
        <li>Buffers (Oil/Spring) – Absorb impact at the shaft bottom</li>
        <li>Bearings & Couplings – For smooth mechanical operation</li>
